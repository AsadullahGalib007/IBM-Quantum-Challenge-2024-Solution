# IBM Quantum Challenge 2024 Solution


This repository includes my solution for the IBM Quantum Challenge 2024. Below is the list of tasks I completed:

- Lab 0: Introductory challenges.
- Lab 1: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).
- Lab 2: Transpiler for circuit optimization.
- Lab 3: AI Transpiler, Circuit Knitting, Serverless Distributed Parallel Computing, and IBM's code assistant.
- Lab 4: Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) on a real Quantum backend. Focus on reducing VQC depth, error suppression, and error mitigation to run on real Quantum hardware.
- Lab 5/Bonus Lab: Extension of lab 4, working on mapping 50 qubits on a 127-architecture system.
